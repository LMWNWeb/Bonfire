# Bonfire
A simple PHP script that can handle HTTP errors.
Make sure the .htaccess file is placed in the root directory of your website or else the script will not work.

Bonfire supports 26 different HTTP error codes.

The following errors are supported: HTTP 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418*, 422, 425, 426, 428, 429, 431, 451

_*418 is not in the htaccess file, if you'd like to use this you'll need to either add it yourself or trigger it manually. See wiki for more info._
